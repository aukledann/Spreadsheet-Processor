**Spreadsheet Processor App**

The Spreadsheet Processor App is a simplified Excel-like tool designed to perform essential spreadsheet functionalities, including:

**Calculations:** Supports functions like SUM, MIN, MAX, and COUNT for ranges of values.

**Cell and Range Operations:** Allows copying individual cells or ranges of cells, even when they overlap.

**File Handling:** Enables saving and loading spreadsheet data to/from a file.

**Motivation:**

I created this project to deepen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles and to practice C++ syntax.

**Outcomes:**

Completing this project significantly boosted my knowledge in:

*Using C++ containers effectively.

*Working with file I/O operations.

*Leveraging the C++ Standard Library for various functionalities.

**Challenges**
Implementing Copy Functionality:
*Handling the complexities of copying overlapping ranges, similar to Excel, was particularly challenging.

Building a String Parser:
*Since all data is entered as strings but might need to be processed as different types, creating a custom parser was both a difficult and fascinating task.
